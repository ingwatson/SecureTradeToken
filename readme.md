# SecureTradeToken

## Description
Program allows users to securely manage trade data by filling out a customizable form, encrypting the data with a password, and generating a token. This token can then be shared with another user, who can decrypt it using the same password to access the original data.
This process ensures that sensitive information is protected during transmission and storage, making it ideal for secure trade transactions.
